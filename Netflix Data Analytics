SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

-- List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

-- Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT t.title, p.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" t
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" p
ON p.show_id = t.show_id
WHERE t.title = 'Bright Star';
